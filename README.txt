~ C-Programmed Card Game ~

Created by: Lalit Mada

This program simulates the popular card game, Blackjack. The user will bet money and can compete for a high-score on the provided leaderboard file.

RULES OF BLACKJACK:

The objective of Blackjack is to get a card count as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player competes for a higher card count than the dealer, who will deal the cards to the player.

The game is played in rounds, where you draw 2 cards the first round, and the dealer draws one card. Based on your draw, you can decide whether you would like to hit (draw another card to try and get closer to 21) or stand (stop drawing cards).

Once you have your hand and decide to stand, the dealer will start drawing their cards. Once the dealer reaches a total 17 or higher, they must stop.

If the dealer's total is less than yours once they have stopped drawing cards, or if they go over 21, you win!

*Cards that are a King, Queen or Jack are worth 10.

*Aces are worth 11 if drawn for the first time unless it makes you go over 21, for which it will only be worth 1. If more than one ace is drawn, subsequent aces will count only as 1.

There are several outcomes in this version of the game. Each outcome will make you win or lose your bet in different amounts:

- Drawing 'Blackjack', (first two cards drawn sum to 21) will give you a 2-1 return on your bet

- Reaching 21, or a higher amount than the dealer (while under 21) will win you 1.5x your bet.

- If the dealer 'busts' (goes over 21 when drawing cards), you will receive 1.5x your bet.

- If you tie with the dealer, or you both bust, you will receive your bet back

- Going over 21, or if the dealer gets a higehr total than you (while under 21) you will lose your bet.

- Unlike traditional Blackjack, there is no doubling down, splitting, or insurance bets in this programmed version of the card game.
